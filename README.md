# movie-poster-classifier
Using fast-ai, this project attempts classifies a dataset of movie posters into their respective genres

In this project, we use [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/), a library used to train models and provides high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains. 
First we create 3 databases containing movie posters of 3 genres (horror, romance, superhero) and train our model on the dataset.
After training the model, we clean up our dataset to try and improve the accuracy.
Lastly we test our classifier by selecting a movie poster and checking whether the model can correctly classify it.
